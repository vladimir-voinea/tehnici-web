			Stronghold is a clone of Dropbox, in which the data encryption is done on the client, instead of the server <br/> <br/>
			Currently, dropbox will encrypt the files that it stores on the <strong>server side</strong>, meaning that they have access to the encryption key and can decrypt the user's data at any time. <br/> <br/>

			Both programs use the rsync algorithm for synchronization, but the difference is that before computing signatures or applying patches, Stronghold will encrypt/decrypt the files in memory before taking any action. While this may pose an inconvenience to the users, it adds the extra benefit of having increased privacy. <br/> <br/>

			The advantage of this approach is that the server will have a dramatically reduced load, allowing several users to store their files on the same server. <br/>
